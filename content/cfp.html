<h2>Call for Papers</h2>

<p>
  <b>SoHeal</b> aims to enable and promote collaboration between academia and industry, unifying the <b>views on software health of researchers and practitioners</b>. The workshop's goals are to: (i) raise awareness of practitioners' problems with software health; (ii) familiarize practitioners with the progress made by academia; and (iii) connect the two communities to further advance the body of knowledge and state of the practice on software health.
</p>

<p>We invite position papers of up to 8 pages (including figures, tables and references), all submissions will peer-reviewed and must be submitted through <a href="https://soheal21.hotcrp.com/">HotCrp</a>.<br/>
  Submissions must conform to the <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html" target="_blank">IEEE formatting instructions IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines</a> (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use <code>\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}</code> without including the <code>compsoc</code> or <code>compsocconf</code> options. The review option adds line numbers, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments.
</p>

<p>
    Topics for contributions on software health (at project, community or ecosystem level) include but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>

<li>health of social, technical, legal, process or business;</li>
<li>aspects at ecosystem or project level;</li>
<li>technical health issues related to dependencies;</li>

  All accepted contributions will be presented during the workshop, but only position papers will be included in the proceedings. The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available in the IEEE Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2021. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.
  All submissions should provide unpublished and original work that has not been previously accepted for publication nor concurrently submitted for review in another workshop, conference, journal or book. If the submission is accepted, at least one author must attend the workshop and present the paper in order to include the paper in the proceedings.
</p>

<!-- <p>
  Authors of the papers accepted at SoHeal 2021 will be invited to submit revised, extended versions of their manuscripts for a special issue of <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/science-of-computer-programming" target="_blank">Science of Computer Programming (SCICO)</a>, edited by Elsevier.

<h2>About Open Policies</h2>

<p>
  SoHeal encourage authors to submit artifact packages and/or data sets with their papers, for the sake of transparency, reusability, replicability, and/or reproducibility, as well as for facilitating the peer review process. 
  The following guidelines are recommendations and are not mandatory. 
  Your choice will not affect the review process for your paper.
