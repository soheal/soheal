<h2>Call for Papers</h2>

<p>
  <b>SoHeal</b> aims to enable and promote collaboration between academia and industry, unifying the <b>views on software health of researchers and practitioners</b>. The workshop's goals are to: (i) raise awareness of practitioners' problems with software health; (ii) familiarize practitioners with the progress made by academia; and (iii) connect the two communities to further advance the body of knowledge and state of the practice on software health.
